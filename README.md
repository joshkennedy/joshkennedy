Hey, I'm Josh. I spent six years doing product design and development with startups in Singapore and New York City before putting down roots in middle Tennessee.

Over the years, I've put my expertise to work as a hired gun, doing freelance design and development work for various clients and agencies. I currently spend my working hours disrupting the toxic money cultue with the fine folks at [Ramsey Solutions](https://www.ramseyinhouse.com).

When I'm not slingin' `divs` and takin' names, you can probably find me hanging out with my beautiful wife and our brood. In my spare time, I like to tinker with [side hustles](https://www.zendstation.com) and [bake bread from scratch](https://www.instagram.com/the_cheeky_baker).
