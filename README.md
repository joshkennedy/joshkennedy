# 👋 
Hey, I'm Josh. After years doing product design and development with startups in Singapore and New York City, my wife and I put down roots in middle Tennessee.

I've also put my expertise to work as a hired gun, doing freelance design and development work for various clients and agencies. I currently work as a Senior Software Engineer at [ClickFunnels](https://www.clickfunnels.com).

When I'm not slingin' `divs` and takin' names, you can probably find me hanging out with my beautiful wife and our brood. In my spare time, I like to tinker with [side hustles](https://www.killswitch.rip) and hang out with friends over an old fashioned.

### Stalk Me
- [Share a giggle](https://www.x.com/joshkennedy) about things I find funny or interesting
- Feast your eyes on [bits of things](https://www.dibbble.com/joshkennedy) I've designed
- Watch me ignore [canned recruiter messages](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshkennedy/)
